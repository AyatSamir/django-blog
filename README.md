# django-blog
I create my django blog project with these features:

1) pagination.

2) sharing posts by email.

3) adding comments.

4) tagging posts.

5) retrieve posts by similarity.

6) creating custom template tags and filters.

7) adding sitemap and post feed.

8) implementing full text search with postgreSQL.
